        <b>Introduction</b>\n\n\n

        Please read these terms of use ("Terms") carefully before accessing and/or using the
        Platform and/or Service. These Terms govern your rights and obligations (whether as a guest
        or a registered user) regarding the access and/or use of cGO’s website, mobile application
        or any Internet service (including any associated software supplied by cGO) (collectively
        referred to as "Platform") under cGO’s control or ownership. These Terms constitute a
        legally binding agreement between PT DTech Solusi Bisnis (including all its subsidiaries,
        related and/or associated companies) (these entities are collectively referred to as "cGO",
        "we", "us" or "our"), the proprietor of all rights in and to the Platform and/or Service,
        and you, the user of the Platform and/or Service.\n\n

        cGO is an online platform that provides access to book a variety of sea travel transportation
        including yacht rental and tour booking outlets (collectively referred to as "Boat" and
        the parties providing such Boat are referred to as "Merchant") in their city ("Service").\n\n

        cGO is a technology company that provides the Platform and/or Service but not the Activities.
        The Service enables cGO members to reserve and join Activities offered by the Merchant.
        It is up to the Merchant to offer their travel activities to cGO users and it is up to cGO
        members to accept such Activities\n\n

        By accessing, browsing, downloading and/or using the Platform and/or Service, you acknowledge
        that you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms, as amended from time to time.
        If you disagree with any part of these Terms, you must immediately discontinue your access
        and/or use of the Platform and/or Service.\n\n

        We may revise or update these Terms at any time by posting a revised/an updated version on
        the Platform. Unless stated otherwise, any revision or update takes effect immediately.
        our continued access and/or use of the Platform and/or Service after a revision or update
        to these Terms constitutes your binding acceptance of the revised or updated Terms.\n\n

        We may change or update the Platform and/or Service and any information on the Platform
        and/or Service at any time without notice to you or liability to us. We may also suspend,
        discontinue, or restrict access to, the Platform and/or Service temporarily or permanently
        at any time without notice to you or liability to us.\n\n\n

        <b>Purchasing and Payments I</b>\n\n

        You are able to purchase yacht or boat rental and tour package at the price displayed at
        each merchant page. When you purchase a travel activity, Organization (Midtrans) will
        process your payment, or hold the credit card number and charge the card for the activity
        at the time activity service is provided and (b) notify you of the purchase.\n\n

        (as may be updated from time to time, "Payment Method") to use the Service. By using the
        Service, you agree to pay us the individual purchase price of Payment Method. This does not
        waive our right to seek payment directly from you through any other methods, should the
        Payment Method fail. We use third party payment service providers to facilitate your Payment
        Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined
        by agreement between you and your financial institution, credit/debit card issuer or other
        provider of your selected Payment Method. We disclaim all liabilities associated with the
        security of the Payment Method. You shall be responsible to resolve any disputes with your
        financial institution, credit/debit card issuer or other provider of your selected Payment
        Method.\n\n

        No refunds: Purchases are not refundable and we will not refund or credit for any partially
        used or unused activities unless you provide credible evidence to us to prove that you have
